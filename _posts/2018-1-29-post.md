	This week, we finished project Luther at Metis which attempted to predict basketball salaries from individual player statistics.

	Gathering the data was an important part of the project. We learned to use various web scraping tools such as Selenium, Scrapy and Beautiful Soup.

	Once the data was collected, I ran several linear models and evaluated the R-squareds.
	After each model, I focused on various ways to improve predictive power.

	The most important aspect of this project was learning how to work iteratively to improve the model.  It started with transforming the response variable using box cox transformation.  Then I reduced features and subsequently added more.

	Finally, although I was able to improve predictive power substantially from the original model, R-squareds actually became negative during cross-validation.

	This was extremely frustrating as I have yet to resolve why.
