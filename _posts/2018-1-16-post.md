title: 5 things I learned my first week at Metis.  
---

5.   Coffee is free!! Yay!

4.   Pandas are not only the big, cuddly bears from China,
        but is also a library built on Numpy that allows Python
         users to quickly manipulate and organize data.         
         
3.   Git is not github and github is not git.  They should work out those
        intellectual property issues but for now, using git was frustrating
        at first but now I'm comfortable with both git and github.
          Now moving on to "get."
        
2.    I'm glad I spent the last 6 months studying machine learning algos and 
        python.  "A battle is won before it is fought..." -Sun Tzu

1.    It takes about 15 minutes for my face to go numb when it is 20 degrees 
        in New York.  When it comes to data science, if you feel your brain
         getting numb from all the things you have to do in your first week
          at a Data Science bootcamp, then you probably came to the right place.
            If you choose to do the things that are easy, your life will be hard.
            If you choose to do the things that are hard, your life will be easy.
            There are many problems that can be solved with data but before I can
            work on them, I must accomplish several things that are hard.
